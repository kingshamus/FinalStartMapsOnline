Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the \"Golden Triangle of Halo\": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.\nHalo 3 introduces \"support weapons\", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time.

The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.\n\nThe additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent's Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.\n\nAdditionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.\n\nAlso carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4175918,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/11577\/image-25430744ed6905ad0bb719ac42b2c91d.jpg?ehk=ZuZFFGsRerqeLdWjV47kdmuTW%2FoqKp5qeflxtpMld2Q%3D&ehkOptimized=FNaNa1DvYRdqI6VhnxUYVwa5w40jyQduGN0jo09CsjU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4175919,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/11577\/image-35415d35aa6ddd7f09b79b562e73df46.png?ehk=0%2FH50A2bPBq1xkrkzyTIqVNLiDoHVnqVLHIisXo1%2FEY%3D&ehkOptimized=goUlrJmS4xh%2FUADByXkDiFe2Yb9WupJa371v8OE54SQ%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":14466,"abbrev":"Samurai Shodown VI","name":"Samurai Shodown VI","displayName":"Samurai Shodown VI","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/samurai-shodown-vi","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"dda9e5dc-0463-f6b9-0169-aea07286616b","releaseDate":848880000,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"fighting","approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely, and the switch-around move, which enabled a player to shift quickly behind the other's back, as well as the dodge (evade, side-step), in which the move virtually brings a semi-3D environment to the defense in attempt to use each sword more effectively.\n\nOne can no longer charge one's own \"pow\" gauge.

Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.\n\nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.\n\nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions \u2013 sometimes even in a full 360 degrees \u2013 by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.\n\nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.\n\nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4167728,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/7621\/image-6c5c440b8e79f8180070d89cebe546e4.jpg?ehk=94XxZVfq4ljC80sLxy2cLdYHthjocc2P%2FbGvTrZ62rA%3D&ehkOptimized=3D0PCKjuC5QSWOAHnZbE4gu1%2F9ce1CCfSuR7u7cyLpU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4167731,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/7621\/image-9bee4981065bfed592eeb6b0949d7e1c.png?ehk=Y22v36HHRZUkSbsshnBgNG94ZnMzIxWxGS2BAjoNfzg%3D&ehkOptimized=dMGbRhga9l1hASlsQy%2F7gpElIKOccWUCPUbkmYMg9%2BQ%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":14696,"abbrev":"Super Bomberman R","name":"Super Bomberman R","displayName":"Super Bomberman R","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/super-bomberman-r","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"871b864e-1182-ee43-8e95-8cdb68f49a37","releaseDate":1488499200,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"\"Since its release in 1985, Bomberman has been a familiar party-battle game for many years.

Mario Party 3 features duel maps, in which two players try to lower each other's stamina to zero using non-playable characters such as Chain Chomps. It is the first Mario Party game to feature Luigi's main voice and also it is last Mario game where Princess Daisy appears in a yellow and white dress, and with long hair, as well as the last Mario game (until New Super Mario Bros. Wii) in which Yoshi's \"record-scratching\" voice is used. It is also the first Mario Party game to have multiple save slots.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4163725,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5789\/image-9467b10fa937426cadabd88b193ebc14.jpg?ehk=SGjNL3ORKye8KyPwejdN94pDj%2F7ZnxmXiPHZqb2BO%2Bc%3D&ehkOptimized=g%2FBFfNrJDDfyPWLIuphNqWeO2caqmBItz6U5Iye1kII%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4163726,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5789\/image-4aab3a06f017d4e2bbc91faf1b4c4d43.png?ehk=zhvn%2Bmb%2Bqu%2BuI5%2FX7mYKhIW2BCxH0SjRFwAK95MFD1E%3D&ehkOptimized=7KaKP6SCsbg8ZsYxLxak%2BHFVRc5jK0WNf14k3xw9DhU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":5957,"abbrev":"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock","name":"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock","displayName":"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"ebd2cee4-ff10-21b2-7c69-612c610f71f4","releaseDate":1193529600,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"Rock out to the third entry in in Red Octane's music series for guitar gods!

Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).\nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s\/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4191227,"width":264,"height":363,"ratio":0.73,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18974\/image-fe6fe08885224192104d6a8c098083e8.jpg?ehk=qQbM6ADMOYLKTQoPfgBq%2BdBHE6ifYRTLfe4j2hkTnxs%3D&ehkOptimized=fPHHJ%2FZ43Sg1xa%2BSAFqhhnONeq%2BoIrkBDf5kINA4dVU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4191228,"width":264,"height":363,"ratio":0.73,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18974\/image-0ec1525aebafb78d2199a91c6a4f2813.png?ehk=oudl4UaaYx3BMmbkYNlOPXFVsrTOT6FWGK1tQhk%2BXpI%3D&ehkOptimized=B8Q4TEb29jsejawGq7IM0j%2B%2BdcYq8%2FNJc4MqStVgWdo%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":33213,"abbrev":"Capcom

It combines several characters from various Sega games, from the complete cast of Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers to Janet from Virtua Cop 2 and the Hornet car from Daytona USA, while allowing to play the bosses of both games without codes.\nHighly advertised, it followed Virtua Fighter 2 as a high-profile 3D fighting game for the Sega Saturn. Intended as an introduction to Virtua Fighter 3 (which was never released for the Saturn), Fighters Megamix utilized the concept originally used by The King of Fighters, whereby characters and styles from different games were mixed together. Not only the open ended rings from VF are present (but now, with no ring-out), but also the closed cages from Fighting Vipers. VF characters have new moves taken from VF3, but the most impressive feature was the dodge move, which allowed characters to sidestep, avoiding a dangerous blow and opening at the same time room for a counter. Sega capitalized on this, calling Fighters Megamix the first \"real 3D\" fighting game in the market.\nUnlike most of AM2's games of the era, Fighters Megamix did not have an arcade release.

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame \"Tekken Ball\", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4162542,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5216\/image-8b23abb6bc9b565d25053068a403cb8b.jpg?ehk=qIqoPu27S3r%2FfUXnNRKCrCAIgCGACN%2Fa%2FLZicS9efL8%3D&ehkOptimized=6acvIyEoEFdzmtxziw%2FfLvilRK2azuR7ogwlirWSDy8%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4162543,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5216\/image-6fd5775898b30241163c0c21fed36667.png?ehk=9ghgMC5WAJvktTO%2B9kgRQwtKa9s6oEGXhTK%2FoLpMEbg%3D&ehkOptimized=lRybfr4BNG%2Fh5KsMzJPOomnsXJfxUabJshbsvm2maIM%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":22398,"abbrev":"Minion Masters","name":"Minion Masters","displayName":"Minion Masters","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/minion-masters","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"95F09475FA8FEF39069592DF8A4ACCD8","releaseDate":1480636800,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"Choose your Minion Master and collect an army of Minions to go head-to-head with other players online, in a real-time Minion battle!

While becoming a card master is a laudable accomplishment, the real goal of the game is to collect all of the cards over 200 in all. If you want to collect all of the cards, you must play human opponents in the Pop mode to get a chance to earn rare cards. All of the complexity of the real-world game has been captured here. Play Pokemon Trading Card Game and become a Pokemon Card Master.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4161196,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/343\/image-2c77a2dc399fdd356a478790672bfddb.jpg?ehk=z97lCpYjQ8yl28srTejCuWUQa0cGHCfwNLt3ndIuheQ%3D&ehkOptimized=5QV%2BNc00n2tbDTCCZuCEBgEDnfPaYRVuJ1l9RIg2wPE%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4161197,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/343\/image-efeb890776619ab9b6aca08f7dc830ed.png?ehk=Sq1zzhGyhL9yVfnnQ%2Fs7BVHiCHWor8n7QYYDTdofuz4%3D&ehkOptimized=YSYJCNsHDUKy0%2BkVZ0NFY%2FeBDhR1EhPFngTMRJGz3vA%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":21839,"abbrev":"Jump Force","name":"Jump Force","displayName":"Jump Force","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/jump-force","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"2ea31428-4070-5b05-33e9-ec2687d2819e","releaseDate":1550188800,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"fighting","approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"For the first time ever, the most famous Manga heroes are thrown into a whole new battleground: our world.

Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers.

Dance Revolution Extreme is a music video game by Konami and is the eighth release in the main Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) series. It was released on December 25, 2002 for Japanese arcades, on October 9, 2003 for the Japanese PlayStation 2, and on September 21, 2004 for the North American PlayStation 2. This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its gameplay and soundtrack is significantly different[1] and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for Best Video Game Soundtrack. \n  \nWhile the PlayStation 2 version came out in North America, the arcade version was exclusive to Japan. Despite this, the arcade version was exported to many arcades in the USA (most of them being bootlegged). Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR arcade franchise for four years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles.

The game is both a sequel and a remake to the previous year's Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, which is itself a prequel to the Street Fighter II series in terms of plot and setting.\n\nThe single-player mode, much like the original Street Fighter Alpha, consists of eight matches with computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player's selected character. Each character also has a secret \"rival\" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode after meeting certain requirements, in which then the rival will interrupt one of the player's regularly scheduled matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed \"Shin Akuma\" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike Super Turbo and the original Alpha, Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player's final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4171049,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/9219\/image-ed10e2db7a1dbdc0fa586eb05186c793.jpg?ehk=OxTRmO%2BzjYvWThQX8LbaBJcbwjVHhOHLv%2FgTrVBQ7%2FI%3D&ehkOptimized=ExvbDtHt6EGVOjCjNgAQPfnIUXj1%2BIi2%2BbXyF4i%2B%2Fv0%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4171050,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/9219\/image-2f79d8e767b6dd4494fa6365545cc150.png?ehk=fjpFHb%2Bq%2FyViwkzzQ8nf%2FyUPUqI1uubPsLqfJgahcps%3D&ehkOptimized=55mAqxmEwCm6%2FZ6eyRdmwL9CiRjVodZ4nItob7ZujsM%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":9881,"abbrev":"Sonic The Fighters","name":"Sonic The Fighters","displayName":"Sonic The Fighters","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/sonic-the-fighters","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"21e823ce-12c0-e27d-9f17-25d0cf88facd","releaseDate":835488000,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"fighting","approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"Sonic The Fighters is an arcade fighting game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series.
