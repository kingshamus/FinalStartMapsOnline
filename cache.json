Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.\n\nStreet Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.\n\nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\n\nLike in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing\/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.\n\nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also \"cancel\" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4164793,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/6438\/image-507f322c4066d47fb586c8637ed89acd.jpg?ehk=PZKY9KW%2F%2FVvaLYV2C%2FezEf6M7ExhswXLkQG3znE5300%3D&ehkOptimized=csUND%2BTUOuo4Odm0QfCNo0quRnhPNHZa9HRU1T1x9ZM%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4164794,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/6438\/image-ad968884f8cfdfeb5966eb1fabbc8de3.png?ehk=JA4K2QNagvDVNkQ%2BIVAQKzajLNP3%2B5DWyGd7tBjbH%2Bg%3D&ehkOptimized=3PS8frqvwU0ifZxz7z%2BjFaHaEnS31aTwZz3x%2B7dIuJY%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":6660,"abbrev":"Mario Superstar Baseball","name":"Mario Superstar Baseball","displayName":"Mario Superstar Baseball","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/mario-superstar-baseball","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"88c88f9c-0885-1f20-1265-f108f0fa9630","releaseDate":1121904000,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"sport","approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"The superstars of the Mushroom Kingdom have gathered on the diamond to power up America's game!

Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1] \n \nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of a guardian spirit that accompanies each character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations on the character's move list and abilities. \n \nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4190403,"width":263,"height":374,"ratio":0.7,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18552\/image-5322b5a9530f0749a3e2225d3958203c.jpg?ehk=1eQxWj8rToAl%2FwDEHvdMSKHaEe%2BEBdqwthjq1tBqR%2Fo%3D&ehkOptimized=6%2Bmh%2BcwO1K34qgpgKKLG6UMf2Qd6XHKr3DqG9%2F7vhHw%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4190404,"width":263,"height":374,"ratio":0.7,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18552\/image-25bfdecaeb25fb494a33803bb9c293e2.png?ehk=n49nCxadoX%2FQ8JQb2wPUAvRpycsI7bEJdPZAW8T76LY%3D&ehkOptimized=4fn2bTb7QYRQcIOOkKDM5Z7t26Sgqk29Vkjs4T99HsI%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":18974,"abbrev":"Fun House","name":"Fun House","displayName":"Fun House","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/fun-house","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"8a6c71f5-b039-c750-3d93-29f413d35a11","releaseDate":633744000,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).\nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s\/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4191227,"width":264,"height":363,"ratio":0.73,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18974\/image-fe6fe08885224192104d6a8c098083e8.jpg?ehk=qQbM6ADMOYLKTQoPfgBq%2BdBHE6ifYRTLfe4j2hkTnxs%3D&ehkOptimized=fPHHJ%2FZ43Sg1xa%2BSAFqhhnONeq%2BoIrkBDf5kINA4dVU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4191228,"width":264,"height":363,"ratio":0.73,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18974\/image-0ec1525aebafb78d2199a91c6a4f2813.png?ehk=oudl4UaaYx3BMmbkYNlOPXFVsrTOT6FWGK1tQhk%2BXpI%3D&ehkOptimized=B8Q4TEb29jsejawGq7IM0j%2B%2BdcYq8%2FNJc4MqStVgWdo%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":22408,"abbrev":"Tatsunoko VS.

It was released on December 25, 2002 for Japanese arcades, on October 9, 2003 for the Japanese PlayStation 2, and on September 21, 2004 for the North American PlayStation 2. This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its gameplay and soundtrack is significantly different[1] and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for Best Video Game Soundtrack. \n  \nWhile the PlayStation 2 version came out in North America, the arcade version was exclusive to Japan. Despite this, the arcade version was exported to many arcades in the USA (most of them being bootlegged). Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR arcade franchise for four years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an in-game thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details. Konami's announcement led people to believe that DDR Extreme might be the final DDR release or that the series might be on hiatus or rebooted in the same manner as Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4161372,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/2907\/image-7943535dcab7ee9d2b534de65585a7a3.jpg?ehk=7D7Eqycsh2BJDUL8Ui29HUHCY%2FbusVPE8GKqVrots2A%3D&ehkOptimized=GtQnZe0zVPGT56K%2FYNW6%2F5JjkngoABa%2BSj1EaV0YEO0%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4161373,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/2907\/image-fb3ad2d7e989fb658591a317e691fe86.png?ehk=7tq0EuyIQFst6LgwelSmwgxLtS1QcGZFVq2wFg45yZg%3D&ehkOptimized=sO1Ndlu%2FaMnZnlYUH35tv%2FClUzHPClirDJprKfOSgZY%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":17408,"abbrev":"In the Groove","name":"In the Groove","displayName":"In the Groove","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/in-the-groove","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"e352613c-82ef-4a57-9f87-8c623a9a49f4","releaseDate":1121558400,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"In the Groove (abbreviated ITG) is the first game in the In the Groove franchise, published by RedOctane and developed by Roxor Games, and first released in video arcades around August 30, 2004.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4188101,"width":264,"height":373,"ratio":0.71,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/17408\/image-91b31d81af4cb4c856306701a53dcfcb.jpg?ehk=Qy0gdXrWDSwCYb2uKGtSCC7YpQq7tK59q6RcF9Ajzow%3D&ehkOptimized=4oSlcZIA5aRz6nKY8nizsZhVhDmnSblTo3iSXb5kK2Q%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4188102,"width":264,"height":373,"ratio":0.71,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/17408\/image-55e9e0d4823d7adcc0dd29c2396be261.png?ehk=uh7hva22n7mFwfzvJB3%2FK3HsRyisPjDHl59pJMgc9tE%3D&ehkOptimized=QYIULrl5SNC7Fb%2Fl7rmCPwpbKs%2FDsRCzGfME88YTxpg%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":42285,"abbrev":"Mario Strikers: Battle League","name":"Mario Strikers: Battle League","displayName":"Mario Strikers: Battle League","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/mario-strikers-battle-league","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":false,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"A1066A0A4B268A1C1380E7276FB2040D","releaseDate":1654819200,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"sport","approvedForOnlineFee":false,"summary":"Introducing Mario Strikers: Battle League, a 5-on-5, soccer-like sport with no rules - do whatever it takes to win!

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame \"Tekken Ball\", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4162542,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5216\/image-8b23abb6bc9b565d25053068a403cb8b.jpg?ehk=qIqoPu27S3r%2FfUXnNRKCrCAIgCGACN%2Fa%2FLZicS9efL8%3D&ehkOptimized=6acvIyEoEFdzmtxziw%2FfLvilRK2azuR7ogwlirWSDy8%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4162543,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5216\/image-6fd5775898b30241163c0c21fed36667.png?ehk=9ghgMC5WAJvktTO%2B9kgRQwtKa9s6oEGXhTK%2FoLpMEbg%3D&ehkOptimized=lRybfr4BNG%2Fh5KsMzJPOomnsXJfxUabJshbsvm2maIM%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":6640,"abbrev":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land","name":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land","displayName":"Kirby's Return To Dream Land","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/kirby-s-return-to-dream-land","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"185569DC332B81D4CEE62323B42D643A","releaseDate":1319414400,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"Kirby and his friends are back in an adventure designed to satisfy longtime Kirby fans and beginners alike.

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\n\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings, and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros. Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys and a series of Nintendogs trading cards. At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4190633,"width":264,"height":242,"ratio":1.09,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18693\/image-b996d18d3a4a6039dbbaf31ac6d9eb35.jpg?ehk=k5DXjGPEo9vnxbcWaPM1jx8XbmnCiQYfwkJfIJJKRCE%3D&ehkOptimized=Hzpd4jFh%2F2Bgcm%2BVLFCAYkv9VrArdfLwf0OxNvfvUrY%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4190634,"width":264,"height":242,"ratio":1.09,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/18693\/image-7b9107584d62e24c5aeeed6584430b5c.png?ehk=tcAamKvlRIhcXXKrvMjAZBiszLw1ulC5tpzaW8Jwz6A%3D&ehkOptimized=3L04GMvRz4u8MMV6jqxMbxAnHGDMhkFaY6iIthlIv8c%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":21850,"abbrev":"Kill la Kill the Game: If","name":"Kill la Kill the Game: If","displayName":"Kill la Kill the Game: If","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/kill-la-kill-the-game-if","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":false,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"76db0b38-0f4d-8bbf-1295-aba32134cb09","releaseDate":1564012800,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"fighting","approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"You control Satsuki Kiryuin as the main protagonist of this game and proceed along with the story while battling against various characters.

Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4163511,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5682\/image-27b0b683012bc92b44f84eaf3bc244af.jpg?ehk=0%2BtoidPxdWrRoJZb3%2F5wberAzpENbvr9MOJuzPhkkb0%3D&ehkOptimized=Uu4NrTkAoq4cyWDGooJjq8XSFMTSyF1uw9ovmm0xpoI%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4163512,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/5682\/image-03d58906c90c4af380492ddd3fa9185e.png?ehk=OuIXRNpfmw48vsH9DxVoaiBhQ8ZbAbPdvLM4AKH3cxA%3D&ehkOptimized=Z0Ozfz5GxxQSCeO2vqte%2BZMd28I%2B6eM1cyeK9swB6YY%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":6553,"abbrev":"Def Jam: Fight for NY","name":"Def Jam: Fight for NY","displayName":"Def Jam: Fight for NY","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/def-jam-fight-for-ny","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"2d3aa6ca-952b-52fd-2fa2-8b46d3a58b76","releaseDate":1095638400,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":"fighting","approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":"The ultimate hip-hop fueled fighting game, Def Jam Fight For NY challenges players to step into the shoes of a ruthless street fighter battling for control of the hip-hop underground.\n\nThe game features an all-new fighting engine including weapons, interactive environments and five unique fighting styles that can be combined to form dozens of customized hybrid styles for the ultimate edge on the streets.\n\nDef Jam Fight For NY features more than 40 of the most well-known artists and personalities in hip-hop today, including Busta Rhymes, Carmen Electra, Lil' Kim, Ludacris, Method Man, Redman, Sean Paul, Slick Rick, Snoop Dogg, and many more.\n* New Fighting Engine -- A new fighting engine challenges you to master multiple fighting disciplines, take advantage of interactive environments, and utilize dozens of weapons to make a name for yourself. \n\n* Three Times the Length of the Original Def Jam VENDETTA -- It's going to take more than 90 fights in 20-plus venues to win control of the streets. \n\n* 40 of the Biggest Hip Hop Artists and Celebrites -- Starring and music by the hottest names in hip hop from Def Jam and beyond -- look for appearances by Busta Rhymes, Carmen Electra, Fat Joe, Flava Flav, Freeway, Ghostface, Ice T, Joe Budden, Kimora Lee Simmons, Lil' Kim, Ludacris, Method Man, Redman, Sean Paul, Slick Rick, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, and many more. \n\n* Five Brutal Fighting Styles -- Master each fighting style: street fighting, kickboxing, martial arts, wrestling, and submission fighting.

The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.\n\nThe additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent's Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.\n\nAdditionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.\n\nAlso carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4175918,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/11577\/image-25430744ed6905ad0bb719ac42b2c91d.jpg?ehk=ZuZFFGsRerqeLdWjV47kdmuTW%2FoqKp5qeflxtpMld2Q%3D&ehkOptimized=FNaNa1DvYRdqI6VhnxUYVwa5w40jyQduGN0jo09CsjU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4175919,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/11577\/image-35415d35aa6ddd7f09b79b562e73df46.png?ehk=0%2FH50A2bPBq1xkrkzyTIqVNLiDoHVnqVLHIisXo1%2FEY%3D&ehkOptimized=goUlrJmS4xh%2FUADByXkDiFe2Yb9WupJa371v8OE54SQ%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":22403,"abbrev":"Ultra Fight Da Kyanta 2","name":"Ultra Fight Da Kyanta 2","displayName":"Ultra Fight Da Kyanta 2","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/ultra-fight-da-kyanta-2","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"14d25d2a-10a2-fd82-050d-3b096023c8e1","releaseDate":null,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4198752,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/22403\/image-2a0d58f347c2c7d16bc16f631af1e47a.jpg?ehk=joa%2Fxcu0f4JlBvMESnHlvfkQdTv3uzwh9UEEvP7VLUk%3D&ehkOptimized=QF2Wm7gNrfEphi1w8OpQ6wGLe5SeWWSPvLMz3jEfGxM%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4198753,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/22403\/image-5ad2c93b6190214ecbd24ba6d0acd2d8.png?ehk=Us5RIxlTk1%2Bl4VEXlvvYpowCWvQRJfSWMlqgDvo4JKg%3D&ehkOptimized=oGKdr4n5ZfL6E4pCV%2BVX7JGtwN0jx3XlHCH89DB9vBg%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":43732,"abbrev":"Tetris","name":"Tetris","displayName":"Tetris","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/tetris--1","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":false,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"74df716a-2347-cc9e-a213-790306df375b","releaseDate":609984000,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":false,"summary":"Tengen, an Atari label, released an unlicensed version of Tetris for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Each character also has a secret \"rival\" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode after meeting certain requirements, in which then the rival will interrupt one of the player's regularly scheduled matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed \"Shin Akuma\" replaces him as a secret opponent.

Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nLink's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.\n\nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.\n\nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions \u2013 sometimes even in a full 360 degrees \u2013 by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.\n\nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.\n\nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).","createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":4167728,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/7621\/image-6c5c440b8e79f8180070d89cebe546e4.jpg?ehk=94XxZVfq4ljC80sLxy2cLdYHthjocc2P%2FbGvTrZ62rA%3D&ehkOptimized=3D0PCKjuC5QSWOAHnZbE4gu1%2F9ce1CCfSuR7u7cyLpU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null},{"id":4167731,"width":264,"height":352,"ratio":0.75,"type":"primary-quality","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/7621\/image-9bee4981065bfed592eeb6b0949d7e1c.png?ehk=Y22v36HHRZUkSbsshnBgNG94ZnMzIxWxGS2BAjoNfzg%3D&ehkOptimized=dMGbRhga9l1hASlsQy%2F7gpElIKOccWUCPUbkmYMg9%2BQ%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":33592,"abbrev":"Beyblade (IRL)","name":"Beyblade (IRL)","displayName":"Beyblade (IRL)","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/beyblade-irl","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":null,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"igdbId":null,"igdbSlug":null,"satoriId":"BB0E3A4CF19CEE0B7137B854303A5EF5","releaseDate":null,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":null,"summary":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":1617962,"width":2000,"height":2000,"ratio":1,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/33592\/image-0bc8490035dd46028a368cba61214c48.jpeg?ehk=0VX%2B8QsTrxSNy4VBWWh3JkDDYbhD0%2BWWR1o9TP8QoPw%3D&ehkOptimized=MX%2FtaohtzAlICVy1cqzLcZUgGn06tlP5ACt34W0aevY%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":46661,"abbrev":"Riichi City","name":"Riichi City","displayName":"Riichi City","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/riichi-city","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":false,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"igdbId":null,"igdbSlug":null,"satoriId":"129b6bab-04a0-8ad5-9e99-478203ccf219","releaseDate":null,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":true,"summary":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null,"images":[{"id":5338886,"width":616,"height":353,"ratio":1.75,"type":"primary","url":"https:\/\/images.start.gg\/images\/videogame\/46661\/image-1601c1bac0adb3199fffc4caa2d93eef.jpg?ehk=KD2CbxRx7LtvegOIKvBG9lvtvrdsxakUwVY7RnqvC0A%3D&ehkOptimized=96EVbcl6lU6DB%2FdL2CdU7yYBenxDThPDsXGqTXcUDUU%3D","isOriginal":true,"entity":null,"entityId":null,"uploadedBy":null,"createdAt":null,"updatedAt":null}],"expand":[]},{"id":50758,"abbrev":"Counter-Strike 2","name":"Counter-Strike 2","displayName":"Counter-Strike 2","minPerEntry":null,"maxPerEntry":null,"approved":true,"slug":"game\/counter-strike-2","isCardGame":false,"hasDeckSupport":false,"characterTerm":"Character","stageTerm":"Stage","gameTerm":"Game","initialStocks":null,"satoriId":"f29dbdce-1bf2-663a-ff33-120142d3b996","releaseDate":1695772800,"isMultiplayer":false,"primaryGenre":null,"approvedForOnlineFee":false,"summary":"For over two decades, Counter-Strike has offered an elite competitive experience, one shaped by millions of players from across the globe.
